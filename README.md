# TypeScript Studies and Tests - OOP Course

Welcome to the repository for TypeScript Studies and Tests, derived from the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. This project aims to solidify learning through hands-on practice and experimentation with concepts covered in the course, utilizing the TypeScript language.

## Overview

The main goal of this repository is to provide an environment where you can:

- Apply concepts learned in the OOP course using TypeScript.
- Conduct experiments and practical tests to deepen understanding.
- Build small exemplary projects to reinforce acquired knowledge.

## Contents

1. **Code Examples:** Explore a variety of TypeScript code examples demonstrating the application of Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

2. **Practical Projects:** Develop practical projects addressing specific challenges related to the course, providing a hands-on experience.

3. **Unit Tests:** Implement unit tests to ensure the robustness and reliability of the code produced during the studies.

## Project Structure

- **/src:** Contains the main source code for examples and practical projects.
- **/tests:** Includes unit tests to validate code functionality.
- **/docs:** Additional documentation, including tutorials and relevant information.
